<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Orange chicken is a flavorful and vibrant dish often found in Chinese-American cuisine. It features tender, bite-sized pieces of chicken that are lightly battered and fried to a 
  golden crisp. These crispy morsels are then coated in a glossy, tangy-sweet orange sauce made from fresh orange juice, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and a touch of sugar. The sauce 
  balances the bright citrus notes with savory undertones, creating a delicious harmony of flavors. Garnished with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and finely chopped green onions, orange 
  chicken is typically served over a bed of steamed white rice, making for a visually appealing and satisfying meal with a delightful contrast of textures and tastes.
