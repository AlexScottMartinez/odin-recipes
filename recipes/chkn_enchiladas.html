<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Chicken enchiladas with sour cream sauce are a delightful and hearty Mexican-inspired dish. Tender shredded chicken is seasoned with a blend
  of spices and wrapped in soft corn tortillas. These filled tortillas are then placed in a baking dish, generously smothered in a rich and creamy 
  sour cream sauce infused with green chilies and garlic for a subtle kick. Topped with a layer of melted cheese, the enchiladas are baked until bubbly
  and golden. The result is a comforting meal with a perfect balance of savory, tangy, and slightly spicy flavors, garnished with fresh cilantro and a 
  squeeze of lime for added brightness.
