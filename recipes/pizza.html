<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Pepperoni pizza is a classic and universally loved dish, featuring a crisp and chewy crust as its foundation. This iconic pizza is topped with a generous layer of tangy tomato 
  sauce, followed by a blanket of melted mozzarella cheese. The star of the show, thin slices of spicy pepperoni, are spread evenly across the surface, curling slightly as they 
  bake to a perfect crisp. The combination of the rich tomato sauce, creamy cheese, and zesty pepperoni creates a mouthwatering medley of flavors. Finished with a sprinkle of Italian 
  herbs and a drizzle of olive oil, each slice offers a delicious blend of savory, spicy, and aromatic tastes.

  <li>1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoons salt</li>
  <li>1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
  <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup oil</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</li>
  <li>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.</li>
  <li>
    Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, 
    a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.
  </li>
  <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
  <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
  <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
